//The idea behind Insertion Sort is dividing the array into the sorted and unsorted subarrays.

//The sorted part is of length 1 at the beginning and is corresponding to the first (left-most) element in the array. 
//We iterate through the array and during each iteration, we expand the sorted portion of the array by one element.


public static void insertionSort(int[] array) {
    for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
        int current = array[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        while(j >= 0 && current < array[j]) {
            array[j+1] = array[j];
            j--;
        }
        // at this point we've exited, so j is either -1
        // or it's at the first element where current >= a[j]
        array[j+1] = current;
    }
}

//Time Complexity - O(n^2)
